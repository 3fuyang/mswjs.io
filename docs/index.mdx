<TextLead>
  Mock Service Worker is an API mocking library that uses Service Worker API to
  intercept actual requests.
</TextLead>

By bringing the ability of [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to capture requests for the purpose of caching, Mock Service Worker enables API mocking on the highest level of the network communication chain. It is the closest thing to a mocking server **without having to create one**.

Since Service Worker is a standard API shipped by all modern browsers, integrating Mock Service Worker into your application, or testing setup, requires no extra configuration, but placing a worker file and declaring mocks.

**Try Mock Service Worker in your application right now, it takes less than 5 minutes.**

## Why to mock API?

There are several reasons to mock an API:

### Development

### Experimenting

### Debugging

1. Develop against a non-existing backend.
1. Experiment with the existing API strategy.
1. Debug a data-related issue.

> Modern applications are often developed in an agile, competitive environment. API mocking is a great technique to develop frontend against a work-in-progress or non-existing backend.

## Mocking in the wild

Most of the mocking libraries operate by using one of the following approaches:

1. Provide a dedicated mocking server to _substitute_ a production server.
1. Stub native `http`/`https`/`fetch` implementations to _intercept_ requests.

### Issues with a mocking server

A dedicated mocking server, although an actual server, may work differently compared to the production one, as each may have a different architecture, technologies, and infrastructure being used. Due to that, a mocking and production servers are not fully interchangable, creating a deviation in behavior that will affect your application.

Establishing a server implies having to run it and, thus, maintain it. This puts extra effort into mocking that starts resembling an actual server development, while not giving a benefit [...]. A mocking server also means a _different_ server that your application needs to speak to in certain scenarios. This requires to adjust the application's code for the sake of mocking, which increases a maintenance cost of such setup.

In short, using a mocking server tests your application against a different server, rather than the same production server that behaves differently.

### Issues with stubbing native modules

Augmenting native request issuing modules is an efficient way to intercept requests while retaining the same application's behavior. However, any change to the native code still creates a deviation between a mocking and non-mocking environments. It is also not advisable to mutate things that you do not own.

Such approach is an optimal compromise, yet will always have tehcnical limitations due to the nature of stubs, giving you a partial assurance in the application's behavior.

## Service Worker benefits

Mock Service Worker leverages a standardized Service Worker API that is designed to intercept requests on the network level, making the mocking completely seamless. Not only this guarantees an identical application's behavior with and without mocks, but also does not require any changes to the application's code for the sake of mocking.

## How does it work?

### Browser

This library establishes a Service Worker that listens to the application's outgoing requests via the `fetch` event, routes those requests to the client-side library's implementation, and sends a mocked response, if any, to the worker to respond with.

Here's a high-level overview of the Mock Service Worker request flow:

### Node

Since Service Workers cannot be run in a non-browser environment, this library provides a designated API to reuse the same mock definitions in Node (for example for testing purposes).

> Node support is achieved by _extending_ native `http`, `https` and `XMLHttpRequest` modules using [`node-request-interceptor`](https://github.com/mswjs/node-request-interceptor) library. Read more about [Usage in Node](/docs/tutorials/usage-in-node).
