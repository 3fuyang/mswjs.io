**Response transformer** is a function that accepts a mocked response and returns a mocked response, applying arbitrary transformations.

</Hint>

## Example

For illustrational purposes let's create a simple response transformer:

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks/redirectStatus.js
export function redirectStatus(res) {
  res.status = 301
  return res
}
```

The transformer above would always set the HTTP status code of the given response to `301`.

We can use this transformer by providing it as an argument to the `res()` function in a responsve resolver:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
// src/mocks/index.js
import { redirectStatus } from './redirectStatus'

setupWorker(
  rest.get('/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(redirectStatus)
  }),
)
```

Of course, setting a fixed status code is rarely what you want. To parametrize this behavior, response transformers are often wrapped in hihg-order functions. In fact, this is how all of the standard-transformers are implemented (i.e. `ctx.status(301)`).

## Standards transformers

Please see the list of standard response transformers available in the [`ctx`](/docs/basics/response-resolver/context#standard-context) argument of a response resolver.

<Hint mode="varning">
  Some response transformers are specific to the type of the API you are mocking
  (REST API or GraphQL), any may not be available when working with a different
  API type.
