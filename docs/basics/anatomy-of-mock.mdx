title: Anatomy of mock
---

Before starting with Mock Service Worker it is great to get a high-level picture of the parts that would make your workflow with the library. Below we are going to look at the example of a mock definition using MSW, and go through each part ...

## Overview

Here is an example of a mock definition file:

```js
// src/mocks.js
import { composeMocks, rest } from 'msw'

const { start } = composeMocks(
  rest.get('/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
    // ...
  }),
)

start()
```

```js
import { composeMocks, rest } from 'msw'
```

```js lineStartNumber=3
const { start } = composeMocks(...)
```

```js lineStartNumber=4
rest.get('/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
```

```js
start()
```

Last, but not least, there is a call of `start()` function that registers and activates a Service Worker.
