### Where is my "public" directory?

A public directory is usually a root directory server by your server (i.e. `./build`, `./public`, or `./dist`). This directory is often committed to Git, and so **should be the Mock Service Worker**.

#### Common public directories

Below you can find a list of public directories in most popular JavaScript project generators.

| Project name                                     | Public directory |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) | `./public`       |
| [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)             | `./public`       |
| [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)                     | `./static`       |

<Hint>
  Not sure where is your public directory? Reach out to the maintainers of the
  development stack that you are using, they should be able to help.
