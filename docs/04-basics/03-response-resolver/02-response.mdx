Response (`res`) is a function that composes a mocked response object.

Unlike the `Response` object in NodeJS, the `res` argument in Mock Service Worker is used to create and transform a mocked response. When called, it passes a created response from one [response transformer](/docs/basics/response-transformer) to another, eventually resolving to a mocked response used by the Service Worker.

## Mocked response

A call to the `res()` function creates a mocked response object. Each response transformer accepted by the `res()` function modifies that mocked response and passes it to the next response transformer, thus, creating a functional composition.

| `statusText`  | `string`                                                                      | HTTP status text of the current status code.                  |
| `body`        | `string`                                                                      | Stringified body of the response.                             |

| `delay`       | `number`                                                                      | Delay duration (ms) before responding with a mocked response. |

## Example

### Raw usage

```js showLineNumbers
rest.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  return res((res) => {
    res.status = 301
    res.headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json')
    return res
  })
})
```

### Usage with standard response transformers

The raw usage example above can be replaced by using standard response transformers.

```js showLineNumbers
rest.get('/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(ctx.status(301), ctx.set('Content-Type', 'application/json'))
})
```
