title: Response resolver
---

**Response resolver** is a function that accepts a matched request and returns a mocked response.

## Parameters

Response resolver function accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter name                                        | Description                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`request`](/docs/basics/response-resolver/request)   | Information about the intercepted request.                 |
| [`response`](/docs/basics/response-resolver/response) | Function to compose the mocked response.                   |
| [`context`](/docs/basics/response-resolver/context)   | Context utilities specific to the current request handler. |

## Examples

### Basic

The basic workflow implies that you pass a response resolver function to a request handler. Response resolver must always return the call of the `res()` function.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=7-15
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

const { start } = setupWorker(
  rest.get(
    '/user',
    // Example of a response resolver that returns
    // a "Content-Type: application/json" response.
    (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(
        ctx.json({
          firstName: 'John',
          age: 38,
        }),
      )
    },
  ),
)

start()
```

### Reusable resolver

Since response resolver is a plain function, you can create a single resolver and reuse it for multiple request handlers.

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks/resolvers/mockUser.js
export const mockUser = (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.json({
      firstName: 'John',
      age: 38,
    }),
  )
}
```

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3,6-7
// src/mocks/index.js
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'
import { mockUser } from './resolvers/mockUser'

const { start } = setupWorker(
  rest.get('/user', mockUser)
  rest.get('/me', mockUser)
)

start()
```
