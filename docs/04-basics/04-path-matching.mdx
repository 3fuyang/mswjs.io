title: Path matching
---

In order to determine which outgoing requests should be mocked, MSW performs request path matching. It's a process when an actual request is compared to the request handlers you've defined when called `composeMocks()` function.

> Path matching is relevant only when mocking a REST API. In case of GraphQL, the predicate is defined by the _operation name_. Learn more about how Mock Service Worker matches GraphQL requests in the [GraphQL API section](/docs/api/graphql).

By default, an outgoing request will be mocked if there is a corresponding request handler that:

- Has the same method;
- Has a matching URL.

## URL matching

It is possible to perform a request's URL matching in three ways:

- Exact URL string;
- Path;
- RegExp.

<Hint>
  URL query parameters and hash <strong>are ignored</strong> when matching
  request URL. It's recommended to omit them when specifying URL or paths in
  request handlers.
</Hint>

## Exacy URL string

Using an exact URL string for the request handler path would match all requests which URL equals to that string.

```js
import { rest } from 'msw'

rest.post('https://api.backend.com/users', responseResolver)
```

> Only `POST https://api.backend.dev/users` requests would match this request handler.

## Path

Similar to how route paths are declared in Express, MSW supports path format for request handlers. Using path allows you to have wildcards and parameters in your URL.

### Patch with wildcard

```js
import { rest } from 'msw'

rest.get('/users/*', responseResolver)
```

### Path with parameters

To add a parameter to your request path use the `:paramName` format.

```js
import { rest } from 'msw'

rest.post('https://api.backend.dev/user/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
  const { userId } = req.params
  // resolve the response...
})
```

You can then access the declared parameters in the `req.params` object. For example, if the application performs a `POST https://api.backend.dev/user/abc-123` request, then `req.params.userId` would equal to `"abc-123"`.

## RegExp

When provided a regular expression, MSW would only mock the requests which URL matches that regular expression. Unmatched requests would be performed as-is.

```js
import { rest } from 'msw'

rest.delete(/\/posts\//, responseResolver)
```

Performing a `DELETE http://localhost:8080/posts/` request will match this request handler. The hostname of the URL matters not in this case, as this regular expression matches a portion of the URL.
