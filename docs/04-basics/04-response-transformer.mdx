title: Response transformer
---

**Response transformer** is a function that accepts a mocked response and returns a mocked response.

When working with Mock Service Worker you don't have to write a custom response transformer, since the library ships with an extensive set of utilities that are enough to work with the supported API types. Please treat this page as **primarily educational**.

## Example

For illustrational purposes let's create a simple response transformer:

```js
// src/mocks/redirectStatus.js
export function redirectStatus(res) {
  res.status = 301
  return res
}
```

The transformer above would always set the HTTP status code of the given response to `301`.

We can use this transformer by providing it to the `res()` function during the mocked response resolution:

```js
// src/mocks/index.js
import { redirectStatus } from './redirectStatus'

composeMocks(
  rest.get('/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(redirectStatus)
  }),
)
```

Of course, setting a hard-coded status code is rarely what you want. Mock Service Worker provides a set of standard transformers that accept dynamic values (like `ctx.status(301)`). It's highly recommended to use them in your daily workflow.

## Standards transformers

Please see the list of standard response transformers available in the [`ctx`](/docs/basics/response-resolver/context#standard-context) argument of a response resolver.

<Hint mode="varning">
  Some response transformers are specific to the type of the API you are mocking
  (REST API or GraphQL), any may not be available otherwise.
</Hint>

## Custom transformer

It is possible to create a [Custom response transformer](/docs/advanced/custom-response-transformer) for better integration with your application's logic. Please refer to the mentioned recipe page for more details.
