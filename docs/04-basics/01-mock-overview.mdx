title: Mock overview
---

This page is going to give you a general idea of what are the counterparts of a mocking process when using Mock Service Worker. This is going to be a **high-level** overview, so don't worry if certain concepts or API doesn't click just yet, it will be examined in more detail in the further sections of the documentation.

Let's look at the example of a mock definition file:

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks.js
import { composeMocks, rest } from 'msw'

const { start } = composeMocks(
  rest.get('/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.status(200),
      ctx.json([
        {
          firstName: 'John',
          age: 32,
        },
        {
          firstName: 'Cathaline',
          age: 28,
        },
      ]),
    )
  }),
)

start()
```

In this file we are creating a request handler for `GET /users` request and return a mocked response that contains a list of users.

Below we are going to analyze this example line-by-line and see what each part does, so you get a better understanding of the process and could write mocks that suit your needs the best.

## Imports

```js showLineNumbers
import { composeMocks, rest } from 'msw'
```

Here you can see we have imported two functions:

- `composeMocks()`, a function that composes given request handlers;
- `rest`, a namespace for handling a REST API.

## Composition

```js showLineNumbers lineStartNumber=3
const { start } = composeMocks(...)
```

## Request handlers

```js showLineNumbers lineStartNumber=4
rest.get('/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
```

## Response resolver

```js showLineNumbers lineStartNumber=6
return res(
  ctx.status(200),
  ctx.json([
    {
      firstName: 'John',
      age: 32,
    },
    {
      firstName: 'Cathaline',
      age: 28,
    },
  ]),
)
```

In this part we are defining a _mocked response_ to our request. To do so, we are calling the `res()` function and provide a list of _response transformers_ as the arguments to it.

## Starting Service Worker

```js showLineNumbers lineStartNumber=22
start()
```

The final step is calling the `start()` function returned from `composeMocks()`. By doing so, you are registering and activating a Service Worker instance responsible for mocking.
