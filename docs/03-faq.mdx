## Is this library secure?

Mock Service Worker library uses a [Service Worker API][service-worker-api] for requests interception. That API is implemented by a browser according to the specification, making the library as secure as the worker's implementation itself.

Moreover, you are in full control over the Service Worker's code (`mockServiceWorker.js`), because you serve it by your application.

## Can I use it with Node?

Yes. Mock Service Worker provides a Node-compatible API to allow you to reuse the same mocking logic in a Node environment (for example, for testing). Please refer to the [Usage in Node](/docs/tutorials/usage-in-node) tutorial for more details.

[service-worker-api]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API

## Can I use it with React Native?

Since React Native does not execute in a browser environment, you cannot run a Service Worker alongside your application.

However, you can use Mock Service Worker in your React Native project for unit and integration tests that run in Node.
Please see the following page for the integration steps:
