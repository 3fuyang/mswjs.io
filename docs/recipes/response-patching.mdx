title: Response patching
---

**Response patching** is a mocking technique when a mocked response is based on the actual response.

This technique may be useful when working with an existing API with an intention to augment it for various purposes (for example, experimenting or debugging).

To perform a response patching using Mock Service Worker you would have to use the `ctx.fetch()` utility that allows to perform a request that **bypasses any mocking definitions**.

Certain scenarios may require to handle a request by retrieving its actual response. To do so, you would have to perform an actual request to the mocked URL in the response resolver using the `ctx.fetch()` utility function. By providing the `req` argument of the [Response resolver](/docs/basics/response-resolver) function to the `ctx.fetch()` call we effectively perform an original request.

```js
import { composeMocks, rest } from 'msw'

const { start } = composeMocks(
  rest.get('https://api.github.com/users/:username', async (req, res, ctx) => {
    // Perform an original request to the intercepted request URL
    const originalResponse = await ctx.fetch(req)

    return res(
      ctx.json({
        location: originalResponse.location,
        firstName: 'Not the real first name',
      }),
    )
  }),
)

start()
```

> It is highly recommended to use `ctx.fetch()` instead of a regular `fetch()` within response resolvers, because it prevents actual requests **from being matched against the MSW mocks definition**.
>
> You may use `fetch()` intentionally, for example, when you need to perform a request that is later mocked as a part of another response resolver. Requests issued by regular `fetch()` are subjected to mocking.

Given the mock definition above, if you performed the following request,

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
```

this is the patched mock response you would get:

```json
{
  "location": "San Francisco",
  "firstName": "Not the real first name"
}
```
