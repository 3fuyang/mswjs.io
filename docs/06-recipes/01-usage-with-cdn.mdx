title: Usage with CDN
---

You can include MSW via a CDN that can serve NPM packages. In this recipe we are going to look on the setup of using this library via CDN.

## Include the package

Pick a suitable CND that can serve NPM modules and include the respective script in your page. You can find a few example using popular CDN below.

### unpkg

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/msw/lib/index.js"></script>
```

### jsDelivr

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/msw/lib/index.js"></script>
```

## Place the Service Worker

It's recommended you use the `npx msw init` command to copy the `mockServiceWorker.js` file into your public directory:

```bash
$ npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR>
```

**Only if you cannot perform this action**, include the `mockServiceWorker.js` file from the CDN. Here's an example of how to do that using `unpkg` CDN:

```js showLineNumbers
// server.js
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'

// Since the Service Worker file **cannot** be included on the page,
// we need to serve it from our server.
app.get('/mockServiceWorker.js', (req, res) => {
  const worker = fetch(
    'https://unpkg.com/msw/lib/mockServiceWorker.js',
  ).then((res) => res.text())

  return res.send(worker)
})
```
