title: Cookies

## Limitations

Fetch specification explicitly forbids setting `Set-Cookie` and `Set-Cookie2` headers when constructing a new `Response` instance for security reasons.

However, since Mock Service Worker executes on the client side, it can provide a functionality as close to receiving a mocked cookie from the response as it can get, without violating security. To achieve that, use the `ctx.cookie()` response transformer function that sets the given cookies on the `document.cookie` string directly.

## Example

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=8
import { composeMocks, rest } from 'msw'

const { start } = composeMocks(
  rest.post('/login', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      // Calling `ctx.cookie()` sets given cookies
      // on `document.cookie` directly.
      ctx.cookie('auth-token', 'abc-123'),
    )
  }),
)

start()
```

> Note that you still won't be able to access the `Set-Cookie` header on the response, as setting a cookie bypasses any network.
