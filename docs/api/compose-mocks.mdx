title: composeMocks()
---

A function that composes the given request handlers into a single mocking schema. Any intercepted request is matched against that schema and the first successful match is used to mock the request.

## Type Definition

```ts
type ComposeMocks = (
  ...requetsHandlers: RequestHandler[]
): SchemaAPI

type SchemaAPI = {
  // Starts a Mock Service Worker
  start: (
    // A custom path to the Service Worker
    serviceWorkerUrl?: string,
    // Service Worker registration options
    registrationOptions?: RegistrationOptions
) => void

  // Stop a running Mock Service Worker
  stop: () => void
}
```

## Examples

```js
import { composeMocks, rest } from 'msw'

const { start } = composeMocks(
  rest.get('*/user/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Maverick',
      }),
    )
  }),
)

// Start the Mock Service Worker
start()
```

> Example above uses the standard `rest` namespace forREST API handling. You can, however, create your custom request handlers.

You can provide a custom Service Worker URL as an argument to the start() function. Please see this recipe for more detailed instructions:
