Starts the Service Worker instance responsible for mocking.

## Options

Calling `start()` accepts the following options:

```ts
interface StartOptions {
  serviceWorker: {
    // Custom Service Worker registration URL
    url: string

    // Custom Service Worker scope
    scope: string
  }

  // Disable matched requests logging in the console
  quiet: boolean
}
```

## Operation

### Reusing worker

When `start()` is called, it looks up an existing worker instance for the given client, and updates it, if found.

### Registering worker

When there is no worker instance controlling the current client, it registers a new Service Worker from the given `StartOptions.url` for the `StartOptions.scope`. Upon registration, the worker signals that its readiness to the client, which enables the mocking.

### Clients map

Internally, the worker file keeps a map of all controlled `clients`. This allows to control mocking per-client (page) basis, allowing one tab of the same project to have mocking, while the other doesn't.

> Whenever a client is closed, it communicates the close event to the worker. When the last client is closed, the worker unregisters itself to prevent affecting unrelated pages on the same host.

## Usage

### Basic usage

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(...mocks)
worker.start()
```

### Custom Service Worker URL

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=9
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(...mocks)
worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    // Notice that the path is relative to the
    // server's root directory, not the `__dirname`.
    url: './assets/mockServiceWorker.js',
  },
})
```

### Custom scope

For the mocking to affect only a part of your application, consider providing a custom `scope` option:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=5
const worker = setupWorker(...)

worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    scope: '/pages/product'
  }
})
```

### Deferred start

When your application performs requests upon start, it may be useful to defer the application's bootstrapping until the mocks are enabled. Since `start()` returns a `Promise`, you can start the application after it resolves.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=4
// src/mocks.js
const worker = setupWorker(...mocks)

export { worker }
```

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=4
// src/index.js
import { worker } from './mocks'

worker.start().then(() => {
  // Bootstrap the application when the mocking is enabled
})
```
