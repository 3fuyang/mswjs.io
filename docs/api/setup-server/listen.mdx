title: listen()
---

Establishes a request interception instance previously configured via `setupServer`.

## Examples

In typical testing setup `.listen()` is called in a `beforeAll` hook, making sure the request interception is at place before your tests run.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

const server = setupServer(/* request handlers */)

beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen()
})
```

> Unlike a similar method on actual servers, `.listen()` operates synchronously, because there is no actual connection in place.
