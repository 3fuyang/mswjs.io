title: Comparison to other tools

Before you consider Mock Service Worker for your application, take a look how it compares to other API mocking solutions.

> TODO Come up with a visual way to compare solutions. A table comparing the same criteria, perhaps?

## JSON Server

- GitHub: [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## MirageJS

- GitHub: [`mirage`](https://github.com/miragejs/miragejs)

## Service Mocker

- GitHub: [`service-mocker`](https://github.com/service-mocker/service-mocker/)

Similar to Mock Service Worker, [Service Mocker](https://service-mocker.js.org/#/) is an API mocking library that leverages Service Worker API for mocking.

## GraphQL query mocking

As Mock Service Worker offers a support for [GraphQL API mocking](/docs/tutorials/mocking-graphql-api), it would be fair to compare it...

> Compare how MSW is different than using something like `MockedProvider` from Apollo. Most likely mocked provider implies you have 1) schema; 2) resolvers.
