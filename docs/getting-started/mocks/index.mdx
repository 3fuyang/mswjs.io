title: Define mocks
order: 22
---

To define which requests should be mocked, we are going to use [request handler](/docs/basics/request-handler) functions. They allow us to capture any request based on its method, URL, or other criteria, and specify which response to return.

## Mock definition

Let's create a file where we will store all our mocking logic. In this tutorial we are going to work mainly with this file.

<Action>
  Create a <code>mocks.js</code> file in your project:
</Action>

```bash
$ touch src/mocks.js
```

## Choose an API

The way we mock an API with Mock Service Worker resembles how that API is being used. Please follow the respective steps below, depending on the API type you would like to mock.

<Action>Choose an API type below:</Action>

import * as MockingRestApiPage from './rest-api.mdx'
import * as MockingGraphQLApiPage from './graphql-api.mdx'

<PageLink
  page={MockingRestApiPage}
  url="/docs/getting-started/mocks/rest-api"
/>
<PageLink
  page={MockingGraphQLApiPage}
  url="/docs/getting-started/mocks/graphql-api"
/>

> When in doubt, starting with a REST API is a good choice!
