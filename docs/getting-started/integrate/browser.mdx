## Setup

> Follow this step only if you're intending to use Mock Service Worker in a browser environment.

Mock Service Worker operates client-side by registering a Service Worker responsible for requests interception. However, we don't have to write any of the worker's code by ourselves, but rather copy the worker file distributed by the library. Mock Service Worker provides a dedicated CLI to help us do that.

<Action>
  Execute the <code>init</code> command of the Mock Service Worker CLI:
</Action>

```bash
$ npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR>
```

Replace the `<PUBLIC_DIR>` placeholder with the relative path to your server's public directory. For example, in a Create React App project this command would be:

```bash
$ npx msw init public/
```

import PublicDirSnippet from '../../snippets/public-dir.mdx'

<PublicDirSnippet />

## Start the worker

Let's go to our `mocks.js` file and import a `setupWorker` function from the `msw` package. We will use this function to register the Service Worker and provide it the list of our `mocks`.

<Action>
  Import <code>setupWorker</code> function from the <code>msw</code> package:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2,7-8
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker, /* rest, or graphql */ } from 'msw'

// Our previously defined mocks
const mocks = [...]

const worker = setupWorker(...mocks)
worker.start()
```

> Calling the `start()` method registers and activates the Service Worker that we have placed into our public directory at the beginning of this tutorial.

## Import mocks

In order for our mock definition to excute during the runtime, it needs to be imported into our application's code. However, since mocking is a development-oriented technique, we will be importing our `mocks.js` file _conditionally_, depending on the current environment.

<Hint mode="warning">
  It's <strong>not recommended</strong> to include Mock Service Worker in
  production. Doing so may lead to a distorted experience for your users.
</Hint>
<Action>
  Import the <code>mocks.js</code> file conditionally following one of the
  examples below:
</Action>

### Using conditional import

Adding a conditional import is the optimal choice, as you don't always have access to the project's build configuration.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=5-7
// src/index.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  require('./mocks')
}

ReactDOM.render(...)
```

### Using webpack

If you can access your build configuration, consider importing the mock definition as a conditional entry module. This is the best strategy for your application to know nothing about the mocking.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6-7
// webpack.config.js
const __DEV__ = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    // Conditionally include the mock definition file
    __DEV__ && 'src/mocks.js',

    // Include your application's entry
    'src/index.js',
  ].filter(Boolean),
  // The rest of your webpack config...
}
```

## Verify & Inspect

After restarting your application you should see a successful activation message from Mock Service Worker in your browser's console:

<ConsoleMessage>[MSW] Mocking enabled</ConsoleMessage>

Any requests that match our mock definitions will now be intercepted and mocked.
