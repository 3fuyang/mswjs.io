## Start the worker

Calling the `setupWorker()` function returns a worker instance that we can start and stop to control the mocking. To register the worker let's call the `start()` method at the end of our mock definition file.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=4,6
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(...)

worker.start()
```

> Calling the `start()` method registers and activates the Service worker that we have placed into our public directory at the beginning of this tutorial.

## Import mocks

<Hint mode="warning">
  It's <strong>not recommended</strong> to include Mock Service Worker in
  production. Doing so may lead to a distorted experience for your customers.
</Hint>

### Using webpack

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6-7
// webpack.config.js
const __DEV__ = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    // Conditionally include the mock definition file
    __DEV__ && 'src/mocks.js',

    // Include your application's entry
    'src/index.js',
  ].filter(Boolean),
  // The rest of your webpack config...
}
```

### Using conditional import

In case you are not sure about how to modify your building configuration, you can always provision a conditional import statement in your application's code:

```js
// src/index.js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  require('./mocks')
}
```
