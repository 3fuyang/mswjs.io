title: Install
---

Let's start by installing the `msw` package into our project. To do so, run the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install msw
```

## Initialize

As the next step, we need to copy the Service Worker file into our application. Mock Service Worker provides a dedicated CLI to help us do that.

Execute the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
$ npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR>
```

Replace the `<PUBLIC_DIR>` placeholder with the relative path to your server's public directory. For example, in a Create React App project this command would be:

```bash
npx msw init public/
```

import PublicDirSnippet from '../snippets/public-dir.mdx'

<PublicDirSnippet />
