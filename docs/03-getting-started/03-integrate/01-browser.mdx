## Start the worker

Let's go to our `mocks.js` file and import a `setupWorker` function from the `msw` package. We will use this function to register the Service Worker and provide it the list of our `mocks`.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2,7-8
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker, /* rest, or graphql */ } from 'msw'

// Our previously written mocks
const mocks = [...]

const worker = setupWorker(...mocks)
worker.start()
```

> Calling the `start()` method registers and activates the Service Worker that we have placed into our public directory at the beginning of this tutorial.

## Import mocks

In order for our mock definition to excute during the runtime, it needs to be imported into our application's code. However, since mocking is a development-oriented technique, we will be importing our `mocks.js` file _conditionally_, depending on the current environment.

<Hint mode="warning">
  It's <strong>not recommended</strong> to include Mock Service Worker in
  production. Doing so may lead to a distorted experience for your users.
</Hint>
<Action>
  Import the <code>mocks.js</code> file conditionally following one of the
  examples below:
</Action>

### Using conditional import

Adding a conditional import is the optimal choice, as you don't always have access to the project's build configuration.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=5-7
// src/index.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  require('./mocks')
}

ReactDOM.render(...)
```

### Using webpack

If you can access your build configuration, consider importing the mock definition as a conditional entry module. This is the best strategy for your application to know nothing about the mocking.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6-7
// webpack.config.js
const __DEV__ = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    // Conditionally include the mock definition file
    __DEV__ && 'src/mocks.js',

    // Include your application's entry
    'src/index.js',
  ].filter(Boolean),
  // The rest of your webpack config...
}
```

## Verify & Inspect

After restarting your application you should see a successful activation message from Mock Service Worker in your browser's console:

<ConsoleMessage>[MSW] Mocking enabled</ConsoleMessage>

Any requests that match our mock definitions will now be intercepted and mocked.
