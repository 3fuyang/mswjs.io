title: Define mocks
---

To define which requests should be mocked, we are going to use [request handler](/docs/basics/request-handler) functions. It allows us to capture any requests based on their method, URL, or other criteria, and specifies which response to return.

## Mock definition

Let's create a file where we will store all our mocking logic. In this tutorial we are going to work mainly with this file.

<Action>
  Create a <code>mocks.js</code> file in your project:
</Action>

```bash
$ touch src/mocks.js
```

## Choose an API

The way we are going to mock an API will depend on the API type itself. Mock Service Worker provides tools dedicated to different API types, respecting their specifications, and helping you to mock requests easier.

<Action>Choose an API type below:</Action>

import * as MockingRestApiPage from './01-rest-api.mdx'
import * as MockingGraphQLApiPage from './02-graphql-api.mdx'

<PageLink
  page={MockingRestApiPage}
  url="/docs/getting-started/mocks/rest-api"
/>
<PageLink
  page={MockingGraphQLApiPage}
  url="/docs/getting-started/mocks/graphql-api"
/>

> If in doubt, starting with a REST API is a good choice!
