title: Define mocks
---

To define which requests should be mocked, we are going to use [request handler](/docs/basics/request-handler) functions. It allows us to capture any requests based on their method, URL, or other criteria, and specifies which response to return.

## Mock definition

Let's create a `mocks.js` file where we will store all our mock definitions. We are going to write all the mocking logic in this file in the next steps of this tutorial.

```bash
$ touch src/mocks.js
```

## Choose an API

Mock Service Worker comes with a first-grade support for various API types. Please choose the API type you would be mocking, and refer to the respective section of this tutorial for more details. You can also combiune both!

import * as MockingRestApiPage from './01-rest-api.mdx'
import * as MockingGraphQLApiPage from './02-graphql-api.mdx'

<PageLink
  page={MockingRestApiPage}
  url="/docs/getting-started/mocks/rest-api"
/>
<PageLink
  page={MockingGraphQLApiPage}
  url="/docs/getting-started/mocks/graphql-api"
/>

> If in doubt, starting from a REST API is a good place.
