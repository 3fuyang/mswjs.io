title: Mocking GraphQL API
---

## Pre-requisites

Since we will be working with a GraphQL API, we need to have a GraphQL client installed and configured in our application. We will use the client to dispatch queries and mutations. Please refer to the getting started steps of the respective client.

<Action>Install and configure a GraphQL client</Action>

Here are some GraphQL clients to consider:

- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)

### Supported clients

Any GraphQL client that complies with the GraphQL operations specification can be used with Mock Service Worker. A client must dispatch requests with the following signature:

```ts
interface GraphQLRequest {
  query: string
  variables?: Record<string, any>
}
```

<Hint>
  Some GraphQL clients append extra information to the request's payload. That
  information will be available in the response resolver function.
</Hint>

## Imports

In our `mocks.js` file let's import the essentials we need for mocking a GraphQL API. They are groupped under the `graphql` namespace exposed by the library.

<Action>
  Import <code>graphql</code> from the <code>msw</code> package:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks.js
import { graphql } from 'msw'
```

## Request handler

To handle a GraphQL request we need to specify its _operation kind_ (query/mutation).

In this tutorial we will be mocking a basic login flow for our user. This flow implies handling two operations:

- `Login` mutation;
- `GetUserInfo` query.

<Action>
  Create a request handler by calling <code>graphql[OPERATION_KIND]</code> and
  providing an operation name:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6,9
// src/mocks.js
import { graphql } from 'msw'

const mocks = [
  // Handles a "Login" mutation
  graphql.mutation('Login', null),

  // Handles a "GetUserInfo" query
  graphql.query('GetUserInfo', null),
]
```

## Response resolve

To response to an operation using a mocked response we have to specify it using a response resolve function.

Response resolver is a function that accepts the following arguments:

- `req`, an information about a matching request;
- `res`, a functional utility to create the mocked response;
- `ctx`, a group of functions that help to set a status code, headers, data, etc. on the mocked response.

In GraphQL we describe the response we expect to receive in an operation declaration itself. Let's design the shape of our response for both operations:

```graphql
# Authenticates using the following username
mutation Login($username: String!) {
  login(username: $username) {
    username
  }
}
```

```graphql
# Returns the information about the authenticated user
query GetUserInfo() {
  user {
    username
    firstName
  }
}
```

<Action>
  Provide response resolvers to the previously defined request handlers:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=10-16
// src/mocks.js
import { graphql } from 'msw'

const mocks = [
  // Handles a "Login" mutation
  graphql.mutation('Login', (req, res, ctx) => {
    const { username } = req.variables
    sessionStorage.setItem('is-authenticated', username)

    return res(
      ctx.data({
        login: {
          username,
        },
      }),
    )
  }),

  // Handles a "GetUserInfo" query
  graphql.query('GetUserInfo', (req, res, ctx) => {
    const authenticatedUser = sessionStorage.getItem('is-authenticated')

    if (!authenticatedUser) {
      return res(
        ctx.error({
          //
        }),
      )
    }

    return res(
      ctx.data({
        user: {
          username: authenticatedUser,
          firstName: 'John',
        },
      }),
    )
  }),
]
```

> Utilize things like [`sessionStorage`](), [`localStorage`](), or [IndexDB]() to handle more complex API scenarios and user flows.

## Next step

The mock definition is written, yet there is one last step to perform: enabling the mocking.
