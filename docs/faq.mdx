## How is it different than library XYZ?

Please see the [Comparison](/docs/comparison) page for detailed technical and conceptual comparison between Mock Service Worker and other popular API mocking libraries.

In a nutshell, most solutions provide requests interception on the application level, while Mock Service Worker intercepts requests on the _network level_. It also allows you to use the same mock definition not only for testing, but for development and debugging as well.

## Is this library secure?

Yes.

Mock Service Worker uses [Service Worker API][service-worker-api] for requests interception. That API is implemented by a browser according to the specification, making the library as secure as the worker's implementation itself.

Moreover, you are in full control over the Service Worker's code (`mockServiceWorker.js`), because you serve it by your application.

## Can I use it with Node?

Yes.

Mock Service Worker provides a Node-compatible API to allow you to reuse the same mocking logic in a Node environment (for example, for testing).

## Can I use it with React Native?

Yes, but only for NodeJS integration.

Since React Native does not execute in a browser environment, you cannot run a Service Worker alongside your application.

However, you can use Mock Service Worker in your React Native project for unit and integration tests that run in Node.
Please see the following page for the integration steps:

## Should I commit the Service Worker file to Git?

Yes.

Generally, the decision to commit the `mockServiceWorker.js` file to VCS (i.e. Git) is up to you, but we **highly recommend doing so**. That way all the collaborators would have the same mocking behavior, ensuring consistent experience across the team.

> Alternatively, you can generate the Service Worker file by executing `npx msw init` as a part of your development pipeline.
