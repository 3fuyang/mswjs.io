title: Web Sockets
---

In this tutorial we are going to implement a chat application using [Create React App](#) and mocking the [Web Socket](#) communication with Mock Service Worker. You can follow the same instructions to adopt Web Socket mocking into any other JavaScript or NodeJS application.

## Setup

- Suggest learning resource on Web Sockets in general.
- [Install](/docs/getting-started/install) the `msw` library.

## Difference

Working with sockets is largely different compared to REST or GraphQL API. This difference is reflected in the API that Mock Service Worker provides to mock a Web Socket communication.

### Mock Web Socket server

Similar to how MSW acts as a production HTTP server, in case of Web Sockets MSW allows you to create a mocked Web Socket server instance. Unlike spawning a custom server instance (i.e. using a `ws` package), the benefits of using MSW for Web Socket mocking are:

1. Does not need to run and maintain an actual server;
1. Allows to intercept and send events from any origin (i.e. third-party servers).
1. Allows to create a Web Socket server at a non-existing address.

<Hint mode="warning">
  Unfortunately, Web Socket events cannot be interecpted in a Service Worker.
  This means that the Web Socker support is implemented client-side, making
  events unobservable in a browser's "Network" tab.
</Hint>

### No request handlers

Web Sockets are event-based, so there are no traditional requests at place. Therefore, there are no traditional request handlers from the Mock Service Worker side as well when mocking a Web Sockets communication.

Instead, ...
