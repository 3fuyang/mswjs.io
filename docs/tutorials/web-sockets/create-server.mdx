title: Create a server

Mock Service Worker provides a `ws` API to emulate a production Web Socket server as a part of your mock definition. Such mocked server introduces an interception layer to capture any incoming events from the client and allows to send server-side events.

## Declaration

Let's start by creating a Web Socket server on a non-existing address.

<Action>
  Create a Web Socket server using the <code>ws.link</code> API:
</Action>

```js
import { ws } from 'msw'

const chatServer = ws.link('wss://api.github.com/chat')
```

> Traditionally, there are no actual servers involved. Mock Service Worker operates entirely client-side, providing you a familiar abstraction layer to handle incoming and outgoing events.

There is no need to run or establish a Web Socket server, it comes into affect immediately after its declaration.

## Server life-cycle

A mocked Web Socket server behaves as a regular Web Socket server, meaning it can react to the following events:

| Event        | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `connection` | sdg         |
| `message`    | sdg         |
| `close`      | sdg         |

> Note that each event has its own arguments to the event listener.

For example, to react to a new Web Socket client connecting to the server, attach a `connection` event listener to the mocked Web Socket server:

```js focusedLines=1
chatServer.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('New client connected!', ws.url)
})
```
