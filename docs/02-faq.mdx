## How does this library work?

This library uses a [Service Worker][service-worker-api] that listens to the outgoing requests in your application _performed in a browser_. Let's take a closer look to the architecture of this library.

The sequence diagram above represents the following steps:

1. **Interception**. Browser dispatches a request. Service Worker intercepts an outgoing request by listening to the `fetch` event. This functionality is primarily designed for caching purposes, for example, to check if there is a cached response to the current request.
1. **Preparation**. Service Worker clones the intercepted request and prepares it to be sent to the `msw` client-side counterpart. Since only strings can be sent via the IPC, certain request information is being stripped off, and the request clone is signaled to the library.
1. **Matching**. Client-side library finds a mock definition that handles the intercepted request. Upon match, it executes a [Response resolver](/docs/basics/response-resolver) function associated with that request, and signals a mocked response back to the Service Worker. If the intercepted request didn't match any defined request handlers, a "not found" event is signaled back.
1. **Responding**. Service Worker responds with either a mocked response received from the client-side library, or with the original response, in case no mocks were found.

## Is this library secure?

Mock Service Worker library uses a [Service Worker API][service-worker-api] for requests interception. It is a standardized and well-secured implementation on a browser's side.
