          <h3>Non-invasive</h3>
          <p>
            Forget about stubs and hacks that make your code smell. Leverage a
            dedicated layer of interception to keep your tests clean and shiny.

          <h3>Deviation-free</h3>
          <p>
            Request the same production resources and test the behavior of your
            app. Test what actually matters, leaving the mocking to MSW.

          <h3>Familiar & Powerful</h3>
          <p>
            Use Express-like mocking route definition syntax to capture outgoing
            requests. Parameters, wildcards, regular expressionsâ€”mocking has
            never been easier.
